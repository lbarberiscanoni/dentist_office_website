			<h1>First Visit</h1>
			<h2>Getting Ready</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>We are very excited to see you and your child for your first visit with us. There are several things you can do to help prepare your child for this day. Let your child know that he or she is coming to the dentist. We will probably perform a comprehensive exam, clean your child's teeth, and apply fluoride; we may also take radiographs. Role playing these activities with young children prior to your visit may also make the appointment easier for them.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Children form attitudes about dental visits largey from their parents, friends, and siblings; therefore, it is best to be positive and excited about this big day. We always invite parents to come back to the exam room with their children and share the experience. Parents should also try to avoid negative words like “drill,” “shot,” and “pull” when speaking about a trip to the dentist. Using child-friendly terms greatly helps to allay fears.</p><br>
				<p>Like the ADA (American Dental Association) and AAPD (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry), we recommend that a child visit the dentist by age one. At Upstate Pediatric Dentistry, we work diligently on prevention and education with the hopes that our young patients may never have a cavity! Studies have shown that earlier preventative visits are easier for patients and actually less expensive for parents over time.This also helps foster positive dental attitudes and healthy habits early in life.<br>
