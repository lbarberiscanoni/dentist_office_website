							<p>Since he was a college student at Winthrop University, Dr. Brian has known that he has wanted to practice children’s dentistry. At Winthrop, Dr. Brian received his B.S. in Biology with a minor in Chemistry. He attended the Medical University of South Carolina for dental school, where he received the Pre-doctoral Student Award for Outstanding Promise in the Field of Pediatric Dentistry. As a dental student at MUSC, Dr. Brian served on the Board of Trustees for the American Student Dental Association as the elected representative for five southeastern dental schools. He later returned to MUSC to complete a two-year specialization program in pediatric dentistry, during which Dr. Brian received advanced training in providing comprehensive dental care for infants, children, teenagers, and children with special needs. His residency training also included growth and development, conscious sedation, and hospital dentistry.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Dr. Brian is a Diplomate of the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry. He is a member of the ADA (American Dental Association), AAPD (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry), SSPD (Southeast Society of Pediatric Dentistry), SCDA (South Carolina Dental Association), SCSPD (South Carolina Society of Pediatric Dentistry) and the Greenville County Dental Society. He has served as a volunteer Adjunct Faculty Member at MUSC teaching fourth-year dental students the best techniques for treating pediatric patients. Dr. Brian has also enjoyed having the opportunity to provide dental care in underprivileged communities on trips to Haiti, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Dr. Brian's training in child psychology and experience working exclusively with children enables him to determine the best approach to caring for each patient. He believes the dentist’s office can be a fun place to visit and hopes that every child leaves looking forward to his or her next appointment! He understands that parents play an integral role in their children’s health and always invites them to be present during any procedure.</p>
